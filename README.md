# Tilemap Collision Debug

I couldn't find any working solution online to make my Game Maker collision system using tilemap. So I made this little js script to test and debug GML scripts with use cases.

All you have to do is to download index.html and put some GML like script in `getValidPosition()`. Then open the file in your web browser and see the result.

You can add more use cases to `test()` if you want.
